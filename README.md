# VR-ThreeJS-Test
These are some VR programs I made with ThreeJS. I'm just testing how this works and stuff, nothing special.
Some cool programs in this repositiory: (that you should look at on your phone!)
1. [Eclipse.](https://jchabin.github.io/VR-ThreeJS-Test/eclipse) Made for the 2017 eclipse.
2. [Neat reflections.](https://jchabin.github.io/VR-ThreeJS-Test/reflect)
3. [Fill a room with marbles.](https://jchabin.github.io/VR-ThreeJS-Test/balls) Use the trigger on your headset to shoot marbles.
## You do need a google cardboard for all of these...
