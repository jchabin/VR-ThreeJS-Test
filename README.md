# VR-ThreeJS-Test
These are some VR programs I made with ThreeJS. I'm just testing how this works and stuff, nothing special.
Some cool programs: (that you should look at on your phone!)
1. [Eclipse.](jchabin.github.io/eclipse) Made for the 2017 eclipse.
2. [Neat reflections.](jchabin.github.io/reflect)
3. [Fill a room with marbles.](jchabin.github.io/balls) Use the trigger on your headset to shoot marbles.
